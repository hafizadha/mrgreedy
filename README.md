## 🚨 The Problem

Traditional recruitment is broken. Recruiters and hiring managers face significant challenges that slow down hiring and introduce bias. We're tackling three core issues:

![StelginsHR (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9c9bbd3-df42-4e28-a37c-8bb9f033b28c)


### 🤯 Overwhelmed by Volume
Recruiters are drowning in hundreds of applications for a single opening, many of which are spam, duplicates, or low-quality AI-generated fakes.

### ❌ Risk of Missing Talent & Bad Hires
Rigid keyword-matching filters out good candidates who phrase their experience differently, leading to missed opportunities.

### 📄 Diverse Formatting of Data
Candidate information arrives in multiple formats and layouts, making traditional parsing difficult and inconsistent.

## 🚀 Key Features (Applicant Side)

### 1. Centralized Application Form

- When a candidate submits their resume, our backend endpoint instantly processes the application in a single, synchronous operation. The system parses the resume, analyzes portfolio links, checks for spam, and calculates a final ranking score using sentence similarity.

- Once the analysis is complete, both the original resume file and the fully structured results are saved to our Supabase database. This ensures that a complete, ranked, and fully vetted candidate profile appears on the recruiter's dashboard immediately, ready for review.
