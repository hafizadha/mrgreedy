![Problem Statement](./assets/slide2-problem-statement.png)

### ü§Ø Overwhelmed by Volume
Recruiters are drowning in hundreds of applications for a single opening, many of which are spam, duplicates, or low-quality AI-generated fakes.

### ‚ùå Risk of Missing Talent & Bad Hires
Rigid keyword-matching filters out good candidates who phrase their experience differently, leading to missed opportunities.

### üìÑ Diverse Formatting of Data
Candidate information arrives in multiple formats and layouts, making traditional parsing difficult and inconsistent.
